                    because: (1) Your payment card account does not contain sufficient funds to complete the transaction or the transaction would exceed 
                    the credit limit of the payment card account; (2) You have not provided us with correct payment card information; (3) Your 
                    payment card has expired; or (4) circumstances beyond the Companys control (such as, but not limited to, power out ages, interruptions
